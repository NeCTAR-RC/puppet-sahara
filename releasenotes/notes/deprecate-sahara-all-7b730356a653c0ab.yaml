upgrade:
  - |
    The now deprecated sahara::service::all class that manages the sahara-all service
    is not recommended to be used as the sahara-all service has minimal testing upstream.
    It's recommended that deployments move to using the separate API and engine services
    which can be deployed like shown in the puppet-sahara/examples/basic.pp file.
    Please see below on how to move away from the sahara-all service.

      - Set ```enabled``` to ```false``` in ```sahara::service::all``` will stop the sahara-all service
      - Setup ```sahara::service::api``` and ```sahara::wsgi::apache``` classes
      - Setup ```sahara::service::engine``` class

    Full example on how this is done can be seen in the puppet-sahara/examples/basic.pp
    examples file.
